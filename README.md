# ABOUT

Pomothon (v2.01) is a simple CLI project tracker and Pomodoro timer written in Python by [Pedro Arilla](http://pedroarilla.com). Every session is divided into tasks assigned to specific projects. Pomothon records your work sessions and stores the data in JSON files.

**Note:** The [Pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
