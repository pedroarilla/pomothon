# ABOUT

Pomothon is a simple CLI project manager and time tracker written in Python by [Pedro Arilla](http://pedroarilla.com). Every session is divided into tasks assigned to specific projects. Pomothon helps you to record your work sessions; it stores the data in JSON files and the logs in TXT files.
